--------------

``django-budget`` is a Django and JavaScript app that can track stories
as they are conceived, assembled and published.

It includes an approachable interface that can handle all the daily
demands of planning and assembling content across news organizations
large and small, based on a standards-compliant API that can be used by
other consumers â€” from chatbots to full-screen displays to many other
applications.

Detailed documentation (including a user guide) will be added at a later
date.

Quick start
-----------

#. Install this app into a Django project and virtual environment (more
   information about reaching this stage will also be forthcoming):
